## TEMPLATE 7: Reddit/Forum Approach

**Use for:** reddit.com/r/dubaiproperty

**IMPORTANT:** Don't pitch! Add value first.

"I analyzed what 500 Dubai agents spend on marketing. Here's the breakdown [Data]"

**Post Content:**
```
Throwaway for obvious reasons, but I work in PropTech and have access to data from 500+ UAE real estate agents.

Thought this breakdown might be helpful for agents trying to budget:

**Average monthly marketing spend (Dubai agents):**
- Facebook Ads: AED 3,500 (cost per lead: AED 180)
- Instagram promotions: AED 1,200
- Traditional video production: AED 2,000 per video
- Photography: AED 800
- Graphic design: AED 500
- **Total: ~AED 8,000/month**

**What's actually working:**
[Share genuine insights, data, tips]

**What's not working:**
[More genuine insights]

Happy to answer questions if you have them.

(Not selling anything - just sharing data I have access to)
