## File Naming

Make sure the filenames match EXACTLY as listed above (lowercase, with hyphens).

## Large Video Files

The .mov and .mp4 files are quite large (50MB+). Consider:
1. Uploading to this folder directly if file size is acceptable
2. OR hosting on external video platform (Vimeo, YouTube private) and updating the links in `/app/members/page.tsx`

## After Upload

Once all files are uploaded, test the members page at:
- Local: http://localhost:3000/members
- Password: "im the best agent in the world"

All download buttons should work correctly.
