      <h2 class="section-title">Why Most Surgeons Lose 60% of Consultations</h2>
      <p style="color: var(--text-muted); margin-bottom: 20px;">You're a brilliant surgeon. But consulting isn't surgery - it's psychology. Here's what's actually happening in most consultations:</p>

      <div style="display: grid; gap: 16px; margin: 24px 0;">
        <div style="padding: 16px; background: rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.1); border-radius: 12px; border-left: 3px solid #ef4444;">
          <strong style="color: #f87171;">❌ The Problem:</strong> You present options and wait for them to decide.
          <br><span style="color: var(--text-muted); font-size: 14px;">This puts all the pressure on them. They freeze and say "I need to think about it."</span>
        </div>
        <div style="padding: 16px; background: rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.1); border-radius: 12px; border-left: 3px solid #22c55e;">
          <strong style="color: #4ade80;">✓ The Solution:</strong> Guide them to the decision they already want to make.
          <br><span style="color: var(--text-muted); font-size: 14px;">They came to you because they want change. Your job is to remove obstacles, not add pressure.</span>

      <h2 class="section-title">The Perfect Consultation Opening</h2>
      <p style="color: var(--text-muted); margin-bottom: 20px;">The first 2 minutes set the tone. Here's how to start with connection, not clinical assessment.</p>

      <div class="script-block">
        <span class="script-label label-you">YOU SAY</span>
        <div class="dialogue">
          "Before we get into any medical stuff, I want to understand YOU. What made you finally decide to come in today? I'm curious - what was the moment that made you think, 'okay, I'm actually going to do this?'"
        </div>
        <div class="tip-box">
          <strong>💡 Why This Works:</strong> This question reveals their emotional motivation - the REAL reason they're there. It's not about the procedure. It's about how they feel when they look in the mirror.

      </div>

      <div class="script-block">
        <span class="script-label label-patient">WHEN THEY ANSWER</span>

          <strong>Listen for:</strong>
          <ul style="margin-top: 8px; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li>"I've hated this for years..."</li>
            <li>"Every time I see photos..."</li>
            <li>"My confidence has been..."</li>
            <li>"After my divorce/weight loss/pregnancy..."</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <span class="script-label label-response" style="margin-top: 16px;">RESPOND WITH</span>
        <div class="dialogue">
          "I completely understand. And I want you to know - feeling that way is valid. This isn't vanity. This is about feeling like yourself again. Let me show you what's possible..."

      <h2 class="section-title">The Top 5 Objections (And How to Handle Each)</h2>

      <!-- Objection 1 -->
      <div class="script-block">
        <span class="script-label label-objection">OBJECTION #1</span>
        <h3 style="margin: 12px 0; font-size: 1.2rem;">"I need to think about it"</h3>
        <div class="dialogue">
          <strong>What they're really saying:</strong> "I'm scared and need reassurance."
        </div>
        <span class="script-label label-response" style="margin-top: 16px;">YOUR RESPONSE</span>
        <div class="dialogue">
          "Absolutely - this is a big decision and you should feel 100% confident. Can I ask what specifically you want to think through? Is it the procedure itself, the timing, the investment, or something else? I want to make sure I've given you all the information you need."
        </div>
        <div class="tip-box">
          <strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> This opens the door to address their REAL concern, which is usually fear of the unknown or cost.
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Objection 2 -->
      <div class="script-block">
        <span class="script-label label-objection">OBJECTION #2</span>
        <h3 style="margin: 12px 0; font-size: 1.2rem;">"It's too expensive" / "I can't afford it"</h3>
        <div class="dialogue">
          <strong>What they're really saying:</strong> "I'm not sure it's worth the investment."
        </div>
        <span class="script-label label-response" style="margin-top: 16px;">YOUR RESPONSE</span>
        <div class="dialogue">
          "I hear you. And I never want finances to be the reason someone doesn't feel confident in their own skin. Let me ask you this - if cost wasn't a factor at all, would you move forward today?"
          <br><br>
          <em>[If they say yes]</em>
          <br><br>
          "Good. Then let's talk about making this work. We have financing options that break this into monthly payments of around $[X]. When you think about what you spend monthly on things that don't give you lasting results - dinners out, clothes you don't love, skincare that doesn't work - this is an investment in how you feel every single day for the rest of your life."
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Objection 3 -->
      <div class="script-block">
        <span class="script-label label-objection">OBJECTION #3</span>
        <h3 style="margin: 12px 0; font-size: 1.2rem;">"I need to talk to my husband/partner"</h3>
        <span class="script-label label-response" style="margin-top: 16px;">YOUR RESPONSE</span>
        <div class="dialogue">
          "Of course - it's important to be on the same page with your partner. Is their concern about the procedure itself, or more about the investment?"
          <br><br>
          <em>[Then]</em>
          <br><br>
          "Here's something I've found: often partners are concerned because they don't fully understand what's involved. Would it help if I gave you some materials to share with them, or even had a brief call to answer their questions? I want them to feel as confident as you do."
        </div>
        <div class="tip-box">
          <strong>💡 Alternative:</strong> "Many of my patients say their partners end up being their biggest supporters once they see the results. Would your partner be supportive if they knew how much this meant to you?"
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Objection 4 -->
      <div class="script-block">
        <span class="script-label label-objection">OBJECTION #4</span>
        <h3 style="margin: 12px 0; font-size: 1.2rem;">"I'm scared of surgery / What if something goes wrong?"</h3>
        <span class="script-label label-response" style="margin-top: 16px;">YOUR RESPONSE</span>
        <div class="dialogue">
          "That fear is completely normal - and honestly, I'd be worried if you weren't taking this seriously. Here's what I want you to know: I've performed over [X,000] procedures. My complication rate is less than [X]%. We operate in a fully accredited facility with a board-certified anesthesiologist. But more importantly, I want YOU to feel safe."
          <br><br>
          "What would help you feel more comfortable? Would you like to speak with a past patient? See more before/afters? Tour our operating facility? I'll do whatever it takes for you to feel confident."

      </div>

      <!-- Objection 5 -->
      <div class="script-block">
        <span class="script-label label-objection">OBJECTION #5</span>
        <h3 style="margin: 12px 0; font-size: 1.2rem;">"I found someone cheaper" / "I'm getting quotes from other surgeons"</h3>
        <span class="script-label label-response" style="margin-top: 16px;">YOUR RESPONSE</span>
        <div class="dialogue">
          "That's smart - you should do your research. Can I share something with you though?"
          <br><br>
          "In plastic surgery, you're not buying a product that's the same everywhere. You're buying my hands, my experience, my artistic eye, and my judgment. I've spent [X] years and trained with [credentials] to develop those skills."
          <br><br>
          "There's a reason people fly from [other cities/countries] to have me do their surgery. And I'll tell you honestly - I see revision patients every week who went somewhere cheaper first. They end up paying twice."
          <br><br>
          "I'm not the cheapest. But I am absolutely committed to giving you a result you'll love for life. That's worth the difference."

          <strong>💡 Key:</strong> Don't ask "Do you want to proceed?" Ask "Which date works for you?" Assume the close.

          <br><br>
          "I'm not trying to pressure you. But I've seen too many patients wait and then be disappointed when they can't get on the calendar when they want. Would it make sense to at least secure a date? You can always move it if needed."
