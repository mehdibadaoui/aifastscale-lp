INSTRUCTIONS
------------
Copy this entire prompt into ChatGPT, Claude, or any AI assistant.
Then upload your reference photo and let the AI generate 3 unique prompts.
Use those prompts in Leonardo AI, Midjourney, or Flux with your same photo.


================================================================================
                              THE PROMPT
================================================================================

You are an expert AI image director and realism specialist. Your task is to
generate THREE completely different image prompts for the SAME real person
(plastic surgeon), based on the reference image I upload.


ABSOLUTE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
-------------------------------
- Use the uploaded image as the absolute identity reference
- The face MUST remain 100% identical in all variations
- Do NOT change: facial features, bone structure, age, skin texture, ethnicity
- No beautification
- No model look
- No AI / plastic skin
- No filters
- No cinematic exaggeration
- If the face looks even slightly different, the result is WRONG


OBJECTIVE
---------
Create ultra-realistic images that look like a real plastic surgeon photographed
in different real-life situations. The images must look so real that no one can
tell they are AI-generated.


VARIATION RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)
--------------------------------
You must generate 3 TOTALLY DIFFERENT PROMPTS, not small tweaks.

Each variation must change:
  - Location
  - Outfit
  - Vibe / context

But always keep:
  - Same face
  - Same identity
  - Same realism level


PLASTIC SURGEON-SPECIFIC STYLE
------------------------------
Each image must feel:
  - Luxury / Premium
  - Trustworthy
  - Accomplished
  - Modern
  - Natural

NOT influencer. NOT fashion model. NOT cinematic movie scene.


SUGGESTED SCENARIOS
-------------------
1. In a luxury clinic consultation room with patient (blurred)
2. At a medical conference presenting
3. In scrubs in a modern operating room setting
4. Professional headshot for website/marketing
5. Reviewing before/after photos on tablet
6. In upscale office with diplomas visible


CAMERA & REALISM RULES
----------------------
For EACH variation, clearly describe:

  - Camera type: professional camera or high-end smartphone
  - Framing: chest-up or shoulders-up
  - Lighting: natural, soft, professional
  - Background: realistic medical/professional environment
  - Micro-details: natural pores, slight imperfections, realistic shadows,
    natural posture

No studio lighting. No dramatic angles. No AI art styles.


OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)
----------------------
Respond with ONLY this structure:

  Variation 1: (full detailed image prompt)

  Variation 2: (full detailed image prompt)

  Variation 3: (full detailed image prompt)

Do NOT add explanations. Do NOT add tips. Do NOT repeat prompts.
Each prompt must be ready to paste directly into an AI image generator
with the same reference image uploaded.


FINAL CHECK BEFORE SENDING
--------------------------
Before answering, verify:
  1. All 3 prompts are clearly different
  2. All look realistic as real photography
  3. All keep the same exact face

If not, regenerate internally before replying.
