# PAGE 2: THE PHONE OPPORTUNITY

## Why Phones Still Win

**The Uncomfortable Truth:**

- 80% of business is still closed over the phone
- A phone call is 10-15x more likely to convert than a form fill
- Every missed/mishandled call = $500-$50,000+ lost
- Your competitors answer on the first ring

**The Problem:**

Most professionals have ZERO phone training.
They wing every call.
They lose thousands every month.

**This Ends Today.**

# PAGE 3: THE PSYCHOLOGY OF PHONE SALES

## What Happens In The First 10 Seconds

### The Caller's Mind:
- "Is this the right number?"
- "Did I interrupt them?"
- "Do they sound competent?"
- "Should I hang up?"

### Their Decision:
Within 10 seconds, they decide to:
- Stay on the line, or
- Find a reason to hang up

**Your Job:** Remove friction, build confidence, take control.

---

## The Three Voice Pillars

### 1. Warmth
- Smile when you answer (they hear it)
- Use their name
- Match their energy (slightly higher)

### 2. Confidence
- No uptalk (statements, not questions)
- Clear, measured pace
- Certainty in your responses

### 3. Control
- You guide the conversation
- You ask the questions
- You propose next steps

# PART 1: INBOUND CALL SCRIPTS

```

**Why It Works:**

## Handling Common Inbound Situations

### Situation: They Just Want Pricing

**Wrong Response:**
```
"Well, it depends... let me explain our pricing..."
```

**Right Response:**
```
"Great question, [Name]. Our [service] typically ranges
from $[X] to $[Y] depending on [factors]. The best way
to give you an accurate number is a quick [consultation/
assessment]. Would you have 15 minutes this week to go
through everything? That way I can give you exact pricing
with no surprises."
```

**Why It Works:**
- Gives a range (shows transparency)
- Explains why it varies
- Moves to appointment
- Promises certainty

---

### Situation: They're Comparison Shopping

**Caller:** "I'm calling a few [professionals] to compare."

**Response:**
```
"Smart approach, [Name]. You should definitely talk to
multiple people before making a decision this important.
What would be most helpful is if I ask you a few questions
so I can tell you honestly if we're the right fit. That
way you're not wasting time. Sound good?"
```

**Why It Works:**
- Validates their behavior
- Positions you as advisor
- Sets up qualification
- Shows confidence

---

### Situation: Not Ready to Commit

**Caller:** "I'm just gathering information right now."

**Response:**
```
"Totally understand, [Name]. Information gathering is the
right first step. Let me give you something useful: I can
[send you our guide / answer your top questions / give you
a quick overview]. That way you have what you need when
you're ready. What questions can I answer right now?"
```

**Why It Works:**
- Respects their position
- Provides value
- Keeps door open
- Gathers contact info

---

### Situation: Wrong Service/Can't Help

**Response:**
```
"I appreciate you calling, [Name]. Based on what you've
shared, this isn't actually something we specialize in.
But I know someone who's great for this - would you like
their number? [Provide referral] And if you ever need
[your service], we'd be happy to help."
```

**Why It Works:**
- Honest and helpful
- Creates referral relationship
- Leaves positive impression
- They'll remember you

YOU: "Hi [Name], it's [Your Name] from [Business Name].
     I wanted to make sure you received the [quote/proposal]
     I sent over. Did you have a chance to review it?"

LEAD: "I looked at it..."

[If they haven't reviewed:]
YOU: "No problem! I know you're busy. What would be a good
     time for a quick call to walk through it together?
     I can answer any questions on the spot."

[If they have reviewed:]
YOU: "Great! What questions came up for you?"

[Answer questions, then:]

```

---

## Outbound Script: Referral Follow-Up

YOU: "Hi, is this [Name]? This is [Your Name] from
     [Business Name]. [Referrer Name] gave me your number

REFERRAL: [Response]

YOU: "[Referrer] and I have worked together on [context],
     and they thought I might be able to help you with
     [their situation]. What's going on with [topic]?"

[Continue as with inbound lead]

KEY: Name-drop the referrer 2-3 times early.
```

---

# PART 3: RECEPTIONIST/TEAM SCRIPTS

## Training Your Front Line

### The Reality:
Your receptionist/team answers most calls.
They are your first impression.
Untrained teams lose you money every day.

---

## Receptionist Core Script

```
[RING]

RECEPTIONIST: "Thank you for calling [Business Name],
              this is [Name]. How may I help you?"

CALLER: [Explains need]

RECEPTIONIST: "I'd be happy to help with that. May I get
              your name please?"

CALLER: "[Name]"

RECEPTIONIST: "Thank you, [Name]. Let me take down a few
              details and get you scheduled with [provider]."

[Gather information]

RECEPTIONIST: "[Name], I have [date/time] available.
              Would that work for you?"

[Confirm appointment]

RECEPTIONIST: "You're all set for [date/time]. We'll send
              a confirmation to [contact]. Is there anything
              else I can help you with today?"

[End call]

RECEPTIONIST: "Thank you for calling [Business Name].
              We look forward to seeing you, [Name]!"
```

---

## Receptionist: Handling "Is [Name] Available?"

```
CALLER: "Is [Name] available?"

RECEPTIONIST: "[Name] is with a client right now, but I
              can definitely help. What's this regarding?"

CALLER: [Explains]

RECEPTIONIST: "Got it. Let me take your information and
              have [Name] call you back. What's your name
              and number?"

[Or, if appropriate:]

RECEPTIONIST: "Actually, I can help you with that right
              now. [Handle the request]"
```

**Never say:**
- "They're not here"
- "They're busy"
- "Can you call back?"

**Always:**
- Offer to help
- Capture their info
- Promise follow-up

---

## Receptionist: Handling Price Shoppers

```
CALLER: "How much do you charge for [service]?"

RECEPTIONIST: "Great question! It depends on a few factors.
              The best way to get an accurate quote is a
              [consultation/assessment]. Would you like to
              schedule one? [Name] typically has availability
              [times]."

CALLER: "Can you just give me a ballpark?"

RECEPTIONIST: "Generally, [service] ranges from $[X] to $[Y],
              but [Name] would want to understand your specific
              situation to give you an exact number. The
              [consultation] is [free/fee]. Should I get you
              scheduled?"
```

---

## Call Transfer Protocol

```
RECEPTIONIST: "[Name], I have [caller name] on the line
              calling about [brief description]. They're
              [warm/hot lead/existing client]. Transferring
              now."

[Transfer]

YOU: "[Caller Name], thanks for holding. [Receptionist]
     filled me in. You're calling about [topic]. How can
     I help?"
```

**Key:** Warm transfers > Cold transfers
Brief the next person before transferring.

# PART 4: OBJECTION HANDLING

## The A-E-A Framework

**A - Acknowledge** the objection
**E - Explore** the real concern
**A - Address** and advance

---

## Common Objections with Scripts

### Objection: "I need to think about it"

```
YOU: "I completely understand. This is an important decision.
     [Acknowledge]

     May I ask what specifically you want to think about?
     [Explore]

     [After they answer - Address based on their concern]

     Often when people say they need to think about it,
     there's a specific concern holding them back. Is there
     something I haven't fully addressed?"
```

---

### Objection: "It's too expensive"

```
YOU: "I hear you, and I appreciate you being upfront.
     [Acknowledge]

     Help me understand - is it that the number is higher
     than you expected, or that it doesn't fit your budget
     right now? [Explore]

[If higher than expected:]
     "What were you expecting to invest? Let me show you
     why this is actually priced [fairly/below market]."

[If doesn't fit budget:]
     "I understand. We do have [payment options/smaller
     packages]. Would one of those help?"

[Either way:]
     "The question isn't really about the cost - it's about
     the value. If I could [solve their problem], would
     $[amount] be worth it?"
```

---

### Objection: "I need to talk to my spouse/partner"

```
YOU: "Of course - important decisions should be made
     together. [Acknowledge]

     What do you think they'll want to know about this?
     [Explore]

     [Based on answer:]
     I can include that information for you to share.
     Better yet, would it help if [they/you both] joined
     a quick call so I can answer questions directly?
     Would tomorrow at [time] work for all three of us?"
```

---

### Objection: "I'm talking to other [professionals]"

```
YOU: "Smart approach - you should absolutely do your due
     diligence. [Acknowledge]

     What criteria are you using to make your decision?
     [Explore]

     [Based on their criteria:]
     Those are exactly the right things to evaluate. Let me
     share how we stack up on [their criteria]...

     [After explaining:]
     At the end of the day, it comes down to who you trust
     and who you feel will get you the best result. I'm
     confident that's us. What would you need to see to
     move forward with us today?"
```

---

### Objection: "I've had a bad experience before"

```
YOU: "I'm sorry to hear that. [Acknowledge]

     Would you mind sharing what happened? [Explore]

     [Listen fully, then:]
     That shouldn't have happened, and I understand why
     you'd be hesitant. Here's how we're different:
     [Specific differentiators]

     We [guarantee/policy] specifically because we know
     trust has to be earned. Would you be open to giving
     us a chance to show you it can be different?"
```

---

### Objection: "I don't have time right now"

```
YOU: "I totally understand - you're busy. [Acknowledge]

     Is it that your schedule is packed, or that this
     isn't a priority right now? [Explore]

[If packed schedule:]
     "What if we found just [30 minutes / a time that works]?
     The time you invest now saves you [hours/headaches]
     later. When's your least busy day?"

[If not priority:]
     "I get it. When would this become a priority? Let me
     follow up with you then. What date works?"
```

---

### Objection: "Send me information"

```
YOU: "Absolutely, I'd be happy to. [Acknowledge]

     What specific information would be most helpful for you?
     [Explore]

     [Based on answer:]
     Perfect. I'll send that over today. When you've had a
     chance to review it, let's connect to answer any
     questions. Would [day/time] work for a quick call?
     I'll send the info now and add that call to both our
     calendars."
```

**Key:** Don't just send information and hope. Schedule the follow-up call NOW.

---

### Objection: "Now's not a good time"

```
YOU: "I respect that. [Acknowledge]

     Is it that this moment is bad, or that the timing
     isn't right for [service] in general? [Explore]

[If bad moment:]
     "No problem. What's a better time to connect?"

[If timing not right:]
     "When do you think the timing would be better?
     [After they answer:]
     Let me reach back out to you then. I'll put a reminder
     for [date]. Sound good?"
```

---

# PART 5: CLOSING SCRIPTS

## The "Assumptive Book" Close

```
YOU: "Based on everything we've discussed, I think
     [service/solution] is exactly what you need.
     I have availability on [day] at [time] or [day]
     at [time]. Which works better for you?"
```

**Key:** Offer specific times, not "when are you free?"

---

## The "Summary" Close

```
YOU: "Let me make sure I have this right. You're dealing
     with [problem]. You want [desired outcome]. And you
     need this handled by [timeframe]. Did I get that right?

     Great. Then here's what I recommend: [Solution].
     To get started, we just need [next step].
     Can we take care of that now?"
```

---

## The "Risk Removal" Close

```
YOU: "I hear some hesitation. Let me make this easy:

     [State your guarantee/low-risk offer]

     You literally have nothing to lose. The only risk
     is not doing anything and continuing to deal with
     [their problem]. Should we move forward?"
```

---

## The "Calendar" Close

```
YOU: "Let me pull up my calendar here...

     I have [specific slot] or [specific slot] available.
     Which of those would work for you?

     [They choose]

     Perfect. You're confirmed for [date/time]. I'll send
     you everything you need before then. Looking forward
     to it."
```

---

## The "Now or Later" Close

```
YOU: "[Name], we can do this one of two ways:

     Option 1: We schedule your [appointment/service] today
     and lock in [benefit/price/time].

     Option 2: We wait, and you call back when [problem]
     gets worse.

     I think Option 1 makes a lot more sense. Don't you?"
```

---

# PART 6: VOICEMAIL SCRIPTS

## The Art of the Callback

### Voicemail Statistics:
- 80% of calls go to voicemail
- Average voicemail callback rate: 5%
- Great voicemail callback rate: 15-20%

---

## Voicemail Script: First Attempt

```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from [Business Name].

You [filled out our form / called earlier / were referred
by [Name]], and I'm calling about [topic].

I have some information that could really help you with
[their situation].

Call me back at [phone number]. Again, that's [repeat
phone number].

Talk soon, [Name]."
```

**Length:** Under 30 seconds
**Key Elements:**
- Say their name
- State why you're calling
- Create curiosity
- Give number twice

---

## Voicemail Script: Second Attempt

```
"Hey [Name], [Your Name] again from [Business Name].

I left you a message yesterday about [topic].

Just want to make sure I didn't fall through the cracks -
I have [valuable information/availability/solution] for you.

Can you call me back at [phone number]?

Thanks, [Name]. Hope to hear from you."
```

---

## Voicemail Script: Third/Final Attempt

```
"Hi [Name], [Your Name] from [Business Name] one more time.

I've tried reaching you a couple times about [topic].

I don't want to be a pest, so this will be my last message.
If you're still interested in [solution/help with problem],
my number is [phone number].

If not, no worries at all. Either way, best of luck with
[their situation].

Take care, [Name]."
```

**Why "Final Attempt" Works:**
- Scarcity/urgency
- Respects their time
- Often prompts callback

---

## Voicemail Script: Referral

```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from [Business Name].

[Referrer Name] suggested I give you a call. They mentioned
you might need help with [topic].

I helped [Referrer] with [their situation] and they thought
I could do the same for you.

Give me a call when you get a chance - [phone number].

Looking forward to connecting, [Name]."
```

---

# PART 7: DIFFICULT CALLER SCRIPTS

## The Angry Caller

```
CALLER: [Angry, upset, venting]

YOU: [Let them finish. Don't interrupt.]

YOU: "I can hear how frustrated you are, and I'm really
     sorry you're dealing with this. [Empathy]

     Let me make sure I understand exactly what happened.
     [Repeat their issue back to them]

     Is that right?

     Okay. Here's what I'm going to do: [Specific action].

     Would that help resolve this for you?"
```

YOU: "Let me pause you there for a second, [Name].
     I want to make sure I'm tracking with you.

     So far, it sounds like [summarize key points].
     Is that the main issue?

     [After they confirm:]
     Perfect. Let me ask you a few quick questions
     so I can point you in the right direction."
```

**Key:** Politely take control. They often appreciate the focus.

---

## The Skeptic

```
CALLER: "How do I know this will actually work?"

YOU: "That's a fair question. You should be skeptical -
     there are a lot of people out there who over-promise.

     Here's why you can trust us:
     [Specific proof - results, testimonials, guarantee]

     But honestly, the best way for you to know is to
     [try our service/talk to our past clients/see for
     yourself]. Would that help?"
```

---

## The "Just Browsing" Caller

```
CALLER: "I'm just looking for information."

YOU: "Of course! Happy to help with that.

     What specifically would you like to know?

     [Answer their questions]

     [Name], based on what you're telling me, it sounds
     like [service] might be a good fit. Would you be
     open to [next step] so we can give you personalized
     information? It's [free/no obligation]."
