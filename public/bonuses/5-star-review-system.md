# PAGE 2: THE REVIEW ECONOMY

## Why Reviews Are The New Currency

**The Data Is Clear:**

- 93% of consumers read reviews before buying
- 72% won't take action until they read reviews
- Businesses with 4+ stars get 80% more clicks
- Each star increase = 5-9% revenue increase
- A single negative review costs ~30 customers

**The Harsh Truth:**

Your competitors are actively collecting reviews.
If you're not, you're losing business to them daily.

**This System Changes Everything.**

# PAGE 3: THE PSYCHOLOGY OF REVIEWS

## Why People Trust Strangers

### Social Proof Hierarchy

1. **Personal Recommendation** (Strongest)
   - Friend or family says "use them"
   - Trust level: Maximum

2. **Verified Customer Review** (Strong)
   - Real person, documented experience
   - Trust level: Very High

3. **Expert Endorsement** (Medium-Strong)
   - Industry authority approval
   - Trust level: High

4. **Company Claims** (Weakest)
   - What YOU say about yourself
   - Trust level: Low

**The Goal:** Move your marketing from Level 4 to Level 2

# PHASE 1: THE REVIEW COLLECTION FRAMEWORK

## The "Happy Client Harvest" System

### Step 1: Identify Peak Happiness Moments

Every client journey has "peak happiness" moments when they're most likely to leave a positive review:

**For Lawyers:**
- Case won/settled
- Charges dropped
- Closing completed
- Positive outcome communicated

**For Dentists:**
- Pain relieved
- Smile transformation revealed
- "Best dental experience" comment
- Compliment on comfort/technology

**For Coaches:**
- First big win achieved
- Revenue milestone hit
- Breakthrough moment
- Goal accomplished

**For Realtors:**
- Offer accepted
- Keys handed over
- Above-asking sale
- Quick sale completed

**For E-commerce:**
- Product exceeds expectations
- Fast shipping noted
- Customer service resolved issue
- Repeat purchase made

### Your Peak Moments (Document Yours):
1. _________________________________
2. _________________________________
3. _________________________________
4. _________________________________
5. _________________________________

---

## Step 2: The "Strike While Hot" Protocol

### Timing Is Everything

**The Golden Window:**
Request reviews within 24-48 hours of peak happiness.

**The Happiness Decay:**
- Day 1: 90% enthusiasm
- Day 3: 70% enthusiasm
- Day 7: 50% enthusiasm
- Day 14: 30% enthusiasm
- Day 30: 10% enthusiasm

**System Rule:** Automate review requests to trigger immediately after peak moments.

---

## Step 3: The Multi-Channel Request System

### Don't Rely on One Method

| Channel | Response Rate | Best For |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| In-Person | 60-80% | High-touch services |
| Text/SMS | 40-50% | Quick transactions |
| Email | 15-25% | Detailed reviews |
| QR Code | 20-30% | Physical locations |
| Follow-up Call | 50-70% | VIP clients |

### The Optimal Stack:
1. In-person mention (plants seed)
2. Same-day text (easy action)
3. Next-day email (for non-responders)
4. Week-later follow-up (final attempt)

---

# PHASE 2: THE ASK SCRIPTS

## How To Ask Without Being Awkward

### The Key Principle:
Don't ask for a "review." Ask them to "share their experience."

**"Review" feels like a favor.**
**"Share your experience" feels like conversation.**

---

## In-Person Ask Scripts

### The Natural Transition
```
"[Name], I'm so glad we could [achieve result] for you.
Quick question - would you be open to sharing your
experience to help others who might be in the same
situation you were in? It only takes 2 minutes and
it would really help."
```

### The Compliment Response
(When they compliment you unsolicited)
```
"Thank you so much for saying that! You know, other
people looking for [service] would really benefit
from hearing that. Would you be willing to share
that same thought in a quick Google review?"
```

### The Results Moment
```
"[Name], seeing results like this is exactly why I
do what I do. If you have 2 minutes, sharing this
experience would help others find the same solution
you did. Here's a direct link - just speak from
the heart."
```

---

- Extreme language, no specifics

4. Contact platform support with evidence
5. Consider legal options if defamatory

---

Turn negative review into positive outcome story.

Many clients will UPDATE their review if you
genuinely fix the problem.

- Yelp filters many legitimate reviews
- Especially from new accounts
