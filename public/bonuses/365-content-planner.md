# FINAL NOTES

## The Compound Effect

Day 1: 1 piece of content = 1 impression
Day 30: 30 pieces = growing audience
Day 90: 90 pieces = real momentum
Day 180: 180 pieces = authority established
Day 365: 365 pieces = dominant presence

**Consistency beats perfection.**

## Your Only Job

Pick the day's prompt.
Adapt it to your niche.
Create. Post. Engage.
Repeat.

**That's it. That's the system.**
