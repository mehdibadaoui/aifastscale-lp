I need you to upgrade my Google Sheets email collection system. Follow the guide in the file "GOOGLE_SHEET_UPGRADE_GUIDE.md" located in my project root directory.

Here's what needs to be done:

1. Read the file: /Users/a1111/aifastscale-lp/GOOGLE_SHEET_UPGRADE_GUIDE.md

2. Update the Google Sheet column headers:
   - Remove: Source, IP Address, User Agent
   - Add: Country, Product Purchased, Upsell Purchased, Payment Method

3. I'll update the Google Apps Script manually (I'll copy the code from the guide)

4. Update the file: /Users/a1111/aifastscale-lp/app/components/EmailOptInModal.tsx
   - Replace the data object to include: country, productPurchased, upsellPurchased, paymentMethod
   - Add the getCountryFromTimezone helper function
   - Make sure it reads the upsell parameter from URL

5. Test the changes on localhost

6. Commit and deploy to production

Important:
- The upsell data comes from URL params (?upsell=blueprint17 or ?upsell=blueprint7)
- Country is determined from browser timezone
- Payment method defaults to "Card" (we can't get real payment method without Stripe webhooks)

Please implement all the code changes from the guide and make sure everything works correctly.
