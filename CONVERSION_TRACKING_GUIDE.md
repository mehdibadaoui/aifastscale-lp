## ðŸŽ¯ Best Tracking Strategy

### **DON'T Connect Platforms**
Keep all 3 pixels independent. Each platform's AI needs its own clean data.

### **DO Use All 3 Platforms**
- **Google Ads** - For search intent (people actively looking)
- **Facebook Ads** - For detailed targeting (age, interests, behavior)
- **TikTok Ads** - For viral reach (younger audience, creative content)

### **Campaign Structure Recommendation:**

**Campaign 1: Awareness**
- Optimize for: ViewContent
- Audience: Broad (real estate agents, entrepreneurs)
- Budget: 40% of ad spend

**Campaign 2: Consideration**
- Optimize for: AddToCart / ClickButton
- Audience: Website visitors (retargeting)
- Budget: 30% of ad spend

**Campaign 3: Conversion**
- Optimize for: Purchase
- Audience: Button clickers who didn't buy
- Budget: 30% of ad spend

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

### **Privacy Compliance:**
Your tracking is GDPR/CCPA compliant as long as:
- âœ… You have a Privacy Policy (you do)
- âœ… Users can opt-out (browsers allow this)
- âœ… No PII is tracked without consent (you're not)

### **Ad Blockers:**
~25% of users block tracking pixels. This is normal. Your conversion tracking will still work for 75% of users, which is industry standard.

### **Attribution Window:**
- Facebook: 7-day click, 1-day view
- TikTok: 7-day click, 1-day view
- Google: 30-day click

This means conversions are attributed to ads clicked within this timeframe.
