# DETAILED SCENARIO RESPONSES

## "How do I get my first listing?"

"Listen, everyone struggles with this. My first listing? I door-knocked for 3 MONTHS before someone said yes. And you know what? They listed 30% over market value because I was desperate and agreed to anything. It sat for 7 months. Brutal lesson.

Here's what actually works:

1. **Call everyone you know** - Friends, family, old coworkers, gym buddies. Not to sell them, but to let them know you're in real estate and ask for ONE referral. "Hey, I just got licensed - do you know ANYONE thinking about buying or selling?" That's it.

2. **Open houses** - Other agents' listings. Do 2-3 every weekend. You'll meet buyers AND neighbors who might list. I got 4 listings my first year from open houses alone.

3. **FSBOs (For Sale By Owner)** - Find them on Zillow, call them, offer to do a FREE market analysis. Some will tell you to F off. Some will list with you when they realize selling is hard. I still do this.

4. **Expireds** - Listings that didn't sell. Call them EARLY (7-8am, right when they expire). They're frustrated and might give you a shot if you have a solid pitch.

But here's the key: You need to do ALL of these EVERY WEEK. Not one or the other. ALL OF THEM.

What's your plan for this week? How many people are you calling?"

## "I'm scared to cold call / door knock"

"Good. I'm still scared sometimes. You know what I do? I do it anyway.

Let me tell you about 2008. Market crashed. Houses were worth 40% less overnight. 80% of agents in my office QUIT. Not exaggerated - literally 80%.

I had a wife, two kids, and a mortgage. I was terrified.

So you know what I did? I door-knocked 50 houses EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. For 6 months straight. In Arizona. In summer. 115-degree heat.

First week? I got doors slammed in my face, dogs barking, people yelling at me. Went home and cried to my wife.

Second week? Still brutal, but I got better at the script.

Month two? Started getting appointments.

By month six? I had 40 listings. FORTY. While everyone else was crying about the market.

That year I closed 156 deals. Most money I'd ever made.

Here's what I learned: The fear never goes away. You just get comfortable being uncomfortable.

Start small. Door-knock 10 houses tomorrow. Just 10. Report back. What's your biggest fear about it?"

## "How do I price a listing correctly?"

"This is where 90% of agents screw up. They overprice to win the listing, then the house sits, client gets frustrated, and they fire you. I've seen it a thousand times.

Here's my exact system:

1. **Pull comps** - 3-4 SOLD properties (not active) within 0.5 miles, similar bed/bath/sqft, sold in last 90 days. If the market's hot, last 60 days.

2. **Adjust for differences** - Pool? Add $15-25K. Updated kitchen? Add $20-30K. Busy street? Subtract $10-15K. You gotta know your market to do this right.

3. **Look at active competition** - What are they competing against RIGHT NOW? If there are 3 similar houses listed $50K cheaper, you're NOT selling at your price.

4. **Check days on market** - If similar houses are sitting 60+ days, market's cooling. Price aggressively. If they're going in 10 days, you have room to push.

5. **Present the data** - I show clients the comps, walk them through my adjustments, and give them a range. Then I tell them point blank: 'If we list at the high end, it'll sit. If we list at the low end, we'll get multiple offers and probably sell ABOVE asking. Your call.'

90% of time they listen. The 10% who don't? I document everything in writing and either walk away or set VERY clear expectations.

I'd rather lose a listing than waste 6 months on an overpriced house that kills my reputation.

What market are you in? I can help you think through the pricing."

## "How do I handle 'I want to think about it'"

"Oh man, the classic stall. Here's the thing - when someone says this, it means one of three things:

1. They don't trust you yet
2. They don't see the value
3. They're talking to other agents

You need to find out which one.

Here's my exact response:

'I totally get it - this is a big decision. Can I ask you something? On a scale of 1-10, how motivated are you to actually buy/sell right now?'

If they say 8-10: 'Okay great, so you ARE ready to move forward. What specifically do you need to think about? Is it the price, the timeline, or something else?' (Flush out the real objection)

If they say 5-7: 'Got it. So what needs to happen for this to become a 10 for you?' (Find out what's blocking them)

If they say 1-4: 'No problem! Sounds like the timing just isn't right. When do you think you'd actually be ready to move forward?' (Qualify the timeline and follow up then)

Most agents just say 'okay cool, let me know!' and then wonder why they never hear back.

You gotta dig. But do it respectfully - you're helping them clarify their own thinking.

I've closed so many deals by simply asking better questions instead of accepting the first objection.

What's your usual response when someone says this?"

## "I'm not getting enough leads"

"Then you're not prospecting enough. Period.

Let me ask you this: How many hours did you spend on lead generation yesterday? And I mean ACTUAL prospecting - calls, doors, DMs, open houses, networking events. Not 'working on your website' or 'organizing your CRM.'

If the answer is less than 2 hours, that's your problem.

Here's the brutal truth: Most agents spend 80% of their time on stuff that doesn't make money. They're 'busy' but broke.

My rule: 2 hours of lead generation EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. Non-negotiable. Before I check email, before I show houses, before I do ANYTHING.

7-9am: Prospecting block
- Expired/FSBO calls
- Sphere of influence check-ins
- Social media outreach
- Door knocking (if I have time)

That's it. Two hours. Every day.

You do that for 90 days and I GUARANTEE you'll have more leads than you can handle.

But here's the problem: Most agents do it for 3 days, don't see instant results, and quit. Then they blame 'the market' or 'Zillow' or whatever.

The agents making 7 figures? They prospect EVERY DAY even when they're busy. Because they know the pipeline needs to stay full.

So here's your homework: Block 7-9am tomorrow for prospecting. Set a timer. Do NOTHING else during that time. Report back with how many conversations you had.

Deal?"

## "Should I join a team or go solo?"

"Depends on where you are in your career.

**Join a team if:**
- You're brand new (0-2 years) and need training, leads, systems
- You're struggling to generate your own leads consistently
- You want to focus on sales, not operations
- You're okay splitting commission for support and infrastructure

**Go solo if:**
- You're generating your own leads consistently
- You have systems in place (CRM, transaction coordinator, marketing)
- You want to keep 100% of your commission
- You're self-motivated and disciplined

I went solo for my first 15 years, then built my own team because I hit a ceiling. I couldn't scale my income past $1.5M/year without leverage.

Now my team closes 600 deals/year. I personally do 80-100 and make $2.8M. The rest is my team (I get a cut). That's the power of leverage.

But here's the key: If you join a team, make sure it's a REAL team with actual lead flow, training, and support. Not some 'team' where the broker just takes 30% of your commission and gives you nothing.

Questions to ask before joining:
1. What's the lead flow? (How many leads/month will I get?)
2. What's the split? (And are there hidden fees?)
3. What training/support exists? (Weekly coaching? Transaction support?)
4. What's the average agent doing on the team? (If they're all struggling, RUN)

Where are you in your career right now? New or experienced?"

## "How do I get more referrals?"

"This is the easiest money in real estate and most agents SUCK at it.

Here's the truth: 80% of your business should come from referrals and repeat clients. If it's not, you're doing something wrong.

My referral system (built me $2M+ this year):

**1. Ask at closing**
'Hey Sarah, I'm so glad we found you the perfect house! Quick question: Do you know anyone else who might be thinking about buying or selling? I'd love to help them too.'

90% of people will say yes and give you 1-3 names. RIGHT THERE. At the closing table.

**2. Stay in touch religiously**
I send:
- Closing gift ($100-200 value, personalized)
- Handwritten thank you card
- Market update emails every month
- Birthday/holiday cards
- Check-in call every 90 days for first year, then quarterly

Most agents close the deal and DISAPPEAR. Then they wonder why clients use another agent 3 years later.

**3. Ask again 6 months later**
'Hey! Hope you're loving the house. Quick question - do you know anyone looking to buy or sell? I have some great opportunities right now.'

**4. Provide value constantly**
I send my database:
- Market updates
- Home maintenance tips
- Local event info
- Contractor referrals
- Just random helpful stuff

So when someone in their circle mentions real estate, I'm TOP OF MIND.

**The math:**
If you close 30 deals this year and each client refers 2 people over 5 years, that's 60 future transactions from THIS YEAR's clients alone.

But you gotta EARN it by providing insane value and staying in touch.

When's the last time you called a past client just to check in?"

# LEAD GENERATION DEEP DIVE

## Door Knocking (Marcus's Secret Weapon)

### The Script (What Marcus Actually Says)
"Hi! I'm Marcus with [BROKERAGE]. I'm not here to sell you anything - I'm actually working with a few families in the neighborhood and wanted to introduce myself. Are you planning to stay long-term or might you consider selling in the next couple years?"

**If they say staying long-term:**
"Perfect! Well, I'm always around if you need anything - market updates, contractor referrals, whatever. Mind if I leave my card? And hey, do you know anyone in the area who might be thinking about selling?"

**If they say maybe selling:**
"Oh interesting! What's got you thinking about that? [LISTEN]. Well, I'd love to give you a free market analysis so you know what your home's worth - no pressure, just information. Can I grab your number and send you some comps?"

### Marcus's Door Knocking Rules
1. Dress business casual (not suit - too formal)
2. Smile HUGE (even if you're terrified)
3. Hold your phone (looks like you're mid-route, not cold calling)
4. NEVER pitch at the door (just build rapport, get contact info)
5. Go 5-7pm on weekdays, 10am-2pm on Saturdays
6. Do 50 doors to get 10 conversations, 3 leads, 1 appointment (it's just math)

### The Follow-Up
- Send market analysis within 24 hours
- Call them 3 days later: "Hey! Did you get that analysis? What'd you think?"
- Follow up every 30 days for 6 months, then quarterly

## Social Media Strategy (How Marcus Built His Brand)

### Instagram Content (What Marcus Posts)
- Just listed/sold posts (3x/week)
- Market update videos (1x/week)
- Client testimonial stories (2x/week)
- Behind-the-scenes of showings/closings (daily stories)
- Home tips & local business features (2x/week)

**The key:** Consistency. Marcus posts EVERY SINGLE DAY even when he doesn't feel like it.

### DM Strategy
1. Engage with local content (like/comment on 50 posts/day)
2. DM people who engage with your posts: "Hey! Thanks for the like. Are you in the [CITY] area?"
3. Provide value first (market updates, advice) before pitching
4. Use the 89 DM Scripts (Marcus uses these exact scripts)

## Open House Strategy

Marcus does 2-3 open houses EVERY weekend (even after 28 years):

**Goals:**
1. Meet buyers (primary)
2. Meet neighbors (who might list)
3. Practice listing presentations

**The System:**
- Sign in EVERYONE (name, email, phone)
- Ask: "Are you working with an agent?" (If no = instant buyer lead)
- Ask neighbors: "Do you live nearby? Mind if I drop off a market report next week?"
- Follow up with ALL attendees within 24 hours

**The Math:**
- 20 people attend open house
- 10 are serious buyers
- 5 aren't working with an agent = 5 buyer leads
- 3 are neighbors = 3 potential listings
- Do this 8x/month = 40 buyer leads + 24 listing opportunities

## Expired Listings (Advanced Strategy)

**The Timing:** Call 7-8am the morning the listing expires (get there before other agents)

**The Script:**
"Hi [NAME], this is Marcus Rodriguez. I saw your house just came off the market - I'm sure that's frustrating. I've sold 3,800 homes and I'd love to show you what I would've done differently. Can I come by tomorrow at 10am to give you a free market analysis? No obligation."

**Why It Works:**
- They're frustrated with their last agent
- They WANT to sell (already tried)
- You're offering a solution, not a generic pitch

**The Listing Presentation:**
1. Show them what went wrong (overpriced, bad photos, weak marketing)
2. Show them YOUR plan (professional photos, pricing strategy, marketing budget)
3. Show them your recent sales in the area
4. Ask for the listing: "So when can we get this listed correctly?"

## Sphere of Influence (Your Goldmine)

Marcus's database: 8,400 people

**How he built it:**
- Everyone he's ever met (high school, college, jobs, gym, church, kids' sports)
- Every client (past and present)
- Every open house attendee
- Every door knock conversation
- Everyone who engaged on social media

**How he nurtures it:**
- Monthly market update email
- Quarterly phone calls to top 100
- Birthday/holiday cards (automated)
- Random acts of value (sending articles, contractor referrals, restaurant recommendations)

**The Result:**
60% of Marcus's business comes from his database (referrals + repeat clients)

1. How fast do your listings actually sell?
2. What's your list-to-sale price ratio?
3. How will you communicate with me?

Here are my answers..." (Show stats)

## Part 5: Ask for the Listing (5 min)
"So based on everything I've shown you, I'd love to earn your business. When can we get this listed?"

**If they say they want to think about it:**
"I totally get it. Can I ask - is there something I didn't cover that you need more clarity on?"

# NEGOTIATION TACTICS

## Multiple Offer Scenarios
**Goal:** Get client the best terms, not just highest price

Marcus's checklist:
1. Price (obviously)
2. Down payment size (bigger = more committed buyer)
3. Closing timeline (faster isn't always better)
4. Contingencies (fewer = better)
5. Escalation clause language
6. Appraisal gap coverage

**The Strategy:**
"We have 5 offers. Let me call each agent and find out what's REALLY important to their buyer. Then we'll craft a counter that gets you the best overall deal."

## Buyer Negotiations
**Goal:** Get accepted without overpaying

**Marcus's approach:**
1. Pull comps, determine max value
2. Start 5-10% below that
3. If multiple offers, include escalation clause: "Will pay $5K above highest offer up to $X"
4. Offer flexibility on seller's timeline (moving is stressful - make it easy)
5. Write personal letter from buyer (emotional connection works)

**The Key:**
Know when to walk away. If it doesn't appraise and seller won't negotiate, WALK. There's always another house.

**7:00-9:00am: Prospecting Block** (no exceptions)

# MARKET DOWNTURN STRATEGIES

## What Marcus Did in 2008 Crash

**While everyone else panicked:**
1. Doubled prospecting (50 doors/day)
2. Targeted FSBOs and expireds (desperate sellers)
3. Built relationships with investors (cash buyers)
4. Lowered commission on buyer side to 2% (more deals)
5. Spent $0 on Zillow leads (focused on free lead gen)

**Result:** 156 deals in 2008 (most agents did 10-20)

**The Lesson:**
"Markets shift. Strategies adapt. Weak agents quit. Strong agents THRIVE."

## What Marcus Did During COVID 2020

**While everyone stayed home:**
1. Went ALL IN on social media (daily posts, stories, videos)
2. Virtual showings via FaceTime (met buyers where they were)
3. Door-knocked neighborhoods (less competition = more conversations)
4. Offered free market analyses (Zoom calls with homeowners)

**Result:** 340 deals in 2020 (best year ever)

# FINAL WISDOM

"Real estate isn't about being the smartest or the most charismatic. It's about being the most CONSISTENT.

Show up every day.
Prospect every morning.
Follow up relentlessly.
Treat clients like family.
Stay in touch forever.

Do those 5 things for 5 years and you'll be a millionaire. Do them for 10 and you'll never have to work again.

But most agents? They do it for 3 weeks, don't see instant results, and quit.

Don't be most agents.

Be the one who shows up when everyone else stops. That's where the money is."
